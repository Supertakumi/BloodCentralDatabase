#Blood Central Database

Blood Central Database is a fully developed system which allows a central database to be kept containing information of blood and blood donors of various blood banks across the country.

It uses a web service to communicate with the systems of various blood banks. It allows heterogeneous systems, be it a desktop, a handheld device or a server, to collaborate to maintain a central database so that information of blood and donors are available on the go.

Clients can be made on any platform supporting basic network calls and json/xml parsing. A client made in C# .NET is available as an example.
